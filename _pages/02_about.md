# About Me

My name is Angel Anton and I'm a software engineer based in Madrid, Spain.

I work as senior mobile developer for [Fidesmo][Fidesmo] and my job is to lead the mobile strategy of the company.

My prefered languages right now are **Swift** and **Kotlin**. I used to loved multiplatform solutions, so I did a lot of Xamarin and Flash in the past.

I have some tendence to use functional programming concepts. I like Reactive Programming, unidirectional architectures and in the future, I want to learn Elm.

Aside from being a developer, I feel at ease using Sketch or Photoshop and I consider myself an **UI** guy. My favourite color scheme is [Solarized][Solarized].

I also cycle and I'm a proud owner of three steel road bikes! :-)
