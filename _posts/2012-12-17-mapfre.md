As part of the release of its new website, Art Collections department inside the [Mapfre Foundation](https://www.fundacionmapfre.org/fundacion/en/) wanted to create an app to navigate on its extensive catalog of works. We proposed to make an app with a simple interface that allows user to play and navigate at the same time.

Leveraging [Flare](http://flare.prefuse.org/), a powerfull data visualization library, we created a system with circles that allowed the users to navigate through categories, years, authors or works hierarchically and change the organizational layout.

The last element in the branch represented an artistic work and it was linked to its respective info file on the Mapfre Foundation website. The app read the data from the same web services as the new website.

The most hard task was to read the complex collections data in JSON. Another challenge was to modify the Flare library to make it consistent with the website look and feel, and then to add some effects and music.
