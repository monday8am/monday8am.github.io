[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is growing faster, it was bought by [Fabric](https://fabric.io/home) and again by Google (as a product of Fabric). In Fidesmo we're totally fans of FastlaneÂ and its huge ecosystem. Here is an example of the `lanes` we use internally:

### Beta Release

The most relevant point of this `lane` is that it takes the version number and _changelog_ from the existing _Git_ information and you don't have to worry about anything, just to define the kind of release you want to publish. To achieve that, the follow steps are executed:

- Ensures that you're in master and the branch is clean
- Reads the last git _TAG_ created and takes its number
- Set the version number according to the semantic parameter passed
- Increment the build number and manage the certificates and provisioning profiles
- Generates the app
- Publish a bump commit
- Publish a Github release
- And finally uploads the app to Fabric!

and the code:

{% gist 0e7f53c515c5d30b40e1410d103a2875 %}

Well, seems to be there are many steps, but using the Fastlane actions all of them are solved easily and you only have to configure them properly. Together with the _Fastfile_, inside the _Fastlane_ folder we have added a configuration file named `.env` with the content:

{% gist 1931e3424eb713a2701278abb98ad9e3 %}


Remember to add the `fastlane/.env` file to your `.gitignore`. Is very important  **NOT**  to publish the `.env` file with your keys onto your repository. 

In order to run the `lane` just type:

{% gist 25b5bb2afcb8444b662799962bc7a3c9 %}

and we are done!
