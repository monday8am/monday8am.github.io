The fashion firm [Pull & Bear](https://www.pullandbear.com/) wanted a **Photobooth** to publish photos using social networks instead of conventional print. Removed paper printing, the device could fit with the _ECOLOGIZE-ME_ campaign recently released, take care of the environment and generate content on social networks linked to the brand.

The main requirement was to build the Photobooth and install it inside a store, allowing users to publish their photos on social networks and administrators to review and select best pictures in order to on Socials or  touchscreens near to the Photobooth.

With a touchscreen, a SLR camera and a convencional photobooth, we built a device with the desired requirements. Besides we developed three applications: _photobooth AIR app_, _web manager based on Flash_ and the _totem AIR app_.

### Photobooth AIR app

A desktop app was developed in order to the users to take photos of their self and publish them on social networks using a simple 3-steps interface. One important requirement was to obtain a high resolution image. Therefore, we developed an special interface using [low level drivers](/blog/2012/05/29/eos-lib.html) to communicate the app with a Canon reflex camera.

### Web manager app

The web application allows to change settings like default language or legals remotely and collects the data related with the photos (total of photos). Besides, the manager visualizes all the photos taken sorted by date or by location.

### Desktop app running on Totems

As part of the communication strategy, several totems were installed near the Photobooth. These totems run an application that allow users to navigate through photos taken in other stores around the world. The photos are pre-selected using the web manager app by the community manager team.

### Impact and results

The project was developed in three months using Adobe AIR technology. Currently there are three devices running in Rotterdam, London and Bologna and another 8 devices are expecting to be installed. The photos shared by the users are very popular who visit the company Facebook page to find theirself. There have been over **7000 photos** uploaded with an average of 24 photos per day.
