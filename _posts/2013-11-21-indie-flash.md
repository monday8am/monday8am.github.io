During three years we have made several games for Tecknosfera DBNet agency including skill, arcade and multi-users games. We have learned how to use physics using [Box2DFlash](http://box2d.org/) framework to build real worlds. And we have used [SmartFoxServer](http://www.smartfoxserver.com/) for integration features for developing multi-user games in real time.

The games have been designed to be published on a game website with a community of **50,000 users** and more than **100,000 visitors per month**. Each game is associated with a big product campaign that includes prizes to users, TV spots and marketing. Building gamest to be played by huge amount of users was an interesting challenge from the security and performance point of view.
