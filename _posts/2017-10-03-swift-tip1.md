Imagine that in your new job, the RESTFul API that will be your friend in the next 6 months isn’t correctly designed. And you receive a different data structure for the same value, depending on external factors that you can’t control. For example, you’ll receive every _text content_ translated into two languages *but* if one is missing, you’ll receive only the default language.

{% gist 632b229bc0b50806d28c79e6d0ab8f23 %}

As the previous JSON shows, we could receive a translated string in multiple forms, as a _dictionary_ or as a _string_. How to deal with that? First let’s try with the straight solution:

{% gist 50e8095c3815c0a49bb289155060e4d5 %}

and this code will fail because a _string_ will be received when a _dictionary_ is expected. In order to improve it, let’s create a custom decoder:

{% gist 50e8095c3815c0a49bb289155060e4d5 %}

We create a _Decodable_ extension to our _TranslatedText_ and try to parse the content as a _single string_ *or* a _dictionary_. Neat and simple. The new *Codable* implementation included in Swift 4 gives us a nice surprise again.

I hope this tip saves you some time :)
